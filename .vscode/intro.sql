----- Comparasion Operators:
-- = Equals to
-- > Greater Than
-- < Less Than
-- >= Greater Than or Equal to
-- <= Less Than or Equal to
-- <> Not equals

-- Using Comparasion Operators with the Payment Table
SELECT * 
FROM payment;


-- Query WHERE amount GREATER THAN $10.
SELECT amount
FROM payment
WHERE amount >10;
-- Query amounts BETWEEN $10-$15
-- NOTE: When using BETWEEN both values are inclusive
SELECT amount
FROM payment
WHERE amount BETWEEN 10 AND 15;

-- Order the payments by amount
-- Using the ORDER BY
-- ASC for ascending order (Default)
-- DESC for decending order
SELECT amount
FROM payment
ORDER BY amount;

SELECT amount
FROM payment
ORDER BY amount DESC
-- Query all payments NOT EQUAL to 2.99
SELECT amount
FROM payment
WHERE amount <> 2.99;

----- Aggregate Functions
-- MIN()
-- MAX()
-- SUM()
-- AVG()
-- COUNT()

-- Query the SUM of amounts GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 5.99
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE amount >= 5.99;



-- Query the AVG of amounts GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 5.99
SELECT AVG(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE amount >= 5.99;


-- Query the COUNT of amounts GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 5.99
SELECT COUNT(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE amount >= 5.99;

-- Query to display the count of DISTINCT amounts paid
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT amount)
FROM payment;


-- Query to display the MIN paid using alias
SELECT MIN(amount) AS min_amount_paid
FROM payment;

-- Query to display the MAX paid using alias
SELECT MAX(amount) AS max_amount_paid
FROM payment;

-- GROUP BY (Used with aggregate functions)
SELECT customer_id, SUM (amount)
FROM payment

-- Query the customer that paid the most
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
